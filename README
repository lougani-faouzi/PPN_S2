	        GENOME ANALYSIS
		   (Genysis)


Implementation of a genetic code analyzer

The purpose is to implement a set of analyses which can provide a deep
insight on the content of very large genetic codes.


src -> all source codes
bin -> all binaries

Split / Split2

First program take a file in FASTA format to prepare the data.
Split data in many files, 1 file = 1 sequence.
This adds pre-processing overhead but can drastically speed up the processing.
Split2 is more efficient.

Genysis

The main program take 2 files in arg. It makes many analyses on the first sequence and
compare them to each other.


	*** COMPILE ***

To compile the code use the following command:

  $ make

To clean binaries:

  $ make clean

To remove all data files, create by the split:

  $ make clean_file


	*** EXECUTE ***

To split FASTA:

  ./bin/split2 sequences.fasta

To analyse:

  ./bin/genysis LC528232.1 6XEZ_T



If the fasta is located here . you can just use the bash script, it will compile, split fasta
and run an analyses on this 2 files, sequences, LC528232.1 & 6XEZ_T

  ./run.sh
